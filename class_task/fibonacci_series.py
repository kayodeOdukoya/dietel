#Write a python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50. Note: The Fibonacci sequesnce is the series of numbers:
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21....

# number = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21



# numberOne = 0
# numberTwo = 1
# for count in range(8):
#     numberThree = numberOne + numberTwo
#     numberOne, numberTwo = numberTwo, numberThree
#     print(numberThree, end='  ')




                            #IN WHILE LOOP
# numberOne = 0
# numberTwo = 1
# count = 1
# while count<9:
#     numberThree = numberOne+numberTwo
#     print(numberThree, end=" ")
#     numberOne = numberTwo
#     numberTwo = numberThree
#     count += 1


                                #CLASS CORRECTION
# x = 0
# y = 1
# sumz = x + y
# while x < 50:
#     print(x, end=' ')
#     x = y
#     y = sumz
#     sumz= x + y
